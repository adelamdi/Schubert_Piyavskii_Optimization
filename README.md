# Schubert_Piyavskii_Optimization
This notebook centers on introducing the Schubert-Piyavskii method and demonstrating its application through a basic Python example. We begin by establishing a foundational understanding of the Schubert-Piyavskii method itself.

The Schubert-Piyavskii method is an iterative algorithm for global optimization problems defined over a closed interval. It is designed to locate the global minimum of a function, guaranteed to converge to this minimum regardless of the presence of local minima.

In [this notebook](Optimization_SchubertPiyavskii.ipynb), we conduct a step-by-step review of the Schubert-Piyavskii method and its connection to Lipschitz continuity.
